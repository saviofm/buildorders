## Version 1.9.0 - 2023-06-22

### Added

- MTXS Migration now checks extensibility configuration if old extensions exist.
- Upgrade now checks if MTXS Migration has been done if old extensions exist and if extensibility is properly configured.
- `GET /-/cds/saas-provisioning/tenant` now returns a `tenant` field, even if the tenant was onboarded with no metadata.
- Token resource now accepts the POST method (can be used with @sap/cds-dk version 7).

## Version 1.8.4 - 2023-06-07

### Fixed

- Further improvement of timeout error handling when fetching uaa tokens.

- The Service Manager now requests the authorization token resiliently.
- MTXS migration script now ignores changes caused by sap.common entities when verifying the migration result.

## Version 1.8.2 - 2023-05-24

### Fixed

- Fix for asynchronous subscriptions with `lazyT0 = true`.
- SAP HANA deployment now correctly evaluates the sql mapping configuration (e. g. `cds.data.sql_mapping.quoted`) also for deployment of `t0`.

## Version 1.8.0 - 2023-05-04

### Added

- Token endpoint can now handle UAA binding with X.509 (mTLS) authentication. On CLI side, this requires @sap/cds-dk@>=6.8.0.

### Changed

- `JobsService`: the job status will now remain `RUNNING` until all tenant tasks have succeeded or failed, instead moving to `FAILED` as soon as there's the first task failure.

### Fixed

### Fixed

- Robustness of MTX Migration has been improved.

## Version 1.6.1 - 2023-03-01

### Fixed

- The lazily onboarded `t0` will now implicitly be created with the same onboarding parameters (e.g. database ID) as the first onboarded tenant.

## Version 1.6.0 - 2023-02-27

### Added

- `t0` onboarding can now happen lazily before the first subscription by setting `cds.requires.['cds.xt.DeploymentService'].lazyT0`.
- E-Tag handling for the `getCsn` API in sidecar scenarios has been introduced.

### Fixed

## Version 1.5.1 - 2023-02-08

### Added

- Jobs are now cleaned up in the database after configurable cutoff times. The following options are possible:
  + `jobCleanupInterval`: Frequency in milliseconds for cleaning up finished or failed jobs. Default is 1 day.
  + `jobCleanupAge`: Time in milliseconds for the minimum age of the failed or finished jobs to delete. Default is 1 day.
  + `jobCleanupIntervalStale`: Frequency in milliseconds for cleaning up queued or running jobs. Default is 7 days.
  + `jobCleanupAgeStale`: Time in milliseconds for the minimum age of the queued or running jobs to delete. Default is 7 days.
- MTXS migration script now allows to cleanup @sap/mtx metadata containers.

### Changed

- `/-/cds/saas-provisioning/tenant`: consumers using the `mtx_status_callback` don't need a SaaS registry binding to the application any more.

### Fixed

- `cds migrate` does not crash any more when no options are supplied.
- `cds-mtx-migrate` command now terminates immediately when the migration is finished.
- Parameter `--dry` for `cds migration` now also skips the creation of the `t0`tenant.
- `ModelProviderService`: Non-repeated dots are now allowed in feature toggles, e.g. `foo.bar.baz` is a valid feature toggle name.

## Version 1.5.0 - 2023-01-27

### Added

- The built-in Service Manager client now caches binding information in-memory.
- The `optimise_file_upload` HDI deployment option is now supported.
- MTX migration script now allows to split extensions based on extension file names using regular expressions.
- Now, provisioning supports SaaS applications using extensibility in combination with migration tables. Before, provisioning failed with a HDI deployment error.
  **Note:** Extending migration table artifacts is not supported.

### Fixed

- MTX migration script now detects enabled multitenancy also for a sidecar project setup.
- Improved robustness for MTX migration script, e. g. with inconsistent old metadata tenants.


## Version 1.4.5 - 2023-01-18

- The authorization header for asynchronous operations is correctly propagated for internal callbacks using `mtx_status_callback`.

## Version 1.4.4 - 2023-01-16

### Changed

- `cds.xt.DeploymentService` configuration has been flattened. Instead of
  ```js
  "hdi": {
    "create": {
      "provisioning_parameters": {
        "database_id": "<ID>"
      },
      "binding_parameters": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  you can now also write
  ```js
  "hdi": {
    "create": {
      "database_id": "<ID>"
    },
    "bind": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
  ```
  The old configuration is still supported, but you're advised to migrate to the new configuration for improved readability.

- `/-/cds/jobs/pollJob` now also returns a `tenants` field, so tenant-specific tasks don't have to be polled individually. An example response format looks like this:
  ```js
  {
    "status": "FAILED",
    "op": "upgrade",
    "tenants": {
        "non-existing-tenant": {
           "status": "FAILED",
           "error": "Tenant 'non-existing-tenant' does not exist"
        },
        "existing-tenant": {
           "status": "FINISHED"
        }
     }
  }
  ```

### Fixed

- `cds.xt.SaasProvisioningService`: `*` is not allowed as a tenant name any more.
- Namespace check for new entities in extensions now also covers new root entities.
- Asynchronous operations now correctly send the callbacks defined via `status_callback` or `mtx_status_callback`.


## Version 1.4.3 - 2022-12-28

### Fixed

- Asynchronous jobs now return a directly-consumable URL for Cloud Foundry deployments in the `Location` header.
- Some incorrect status reports for the job and task polling have been fixed.
- Stability improvements for HANA tenant lifecycle operations, most notably unhandled promise rejections exiting the process have been fixed.

## Version 1.4.2 - 2022-12-19

### Fixed

- `/-/cds/jobs/pollTask` now correctly fetches the task status.
- Jobs now have the correct default `RUNNING` status.

## Version 1.4.1 - 2022-12-16

### Fixed

- Fixed an error with when parsing the tenant metadata when it is empty.
- Async upgrade parallelization via database clustering now works correctly with the new jobs service.
- Improved `tenant_id` correlation for Kibana logging.

## Version 1.4.0 - 2022-12-15

### Changed

- Async API calls now have a `x-job-id` header.
- Improved error handling for the Service Manager client.
- When doing asynchronous updates for multiple tenants, you can now poll the status for each individual tenant. Please continue using the `Location` response header to poll the status for all tenants.
  + This is what a sample response body for an asynchronous request to `/-/cds/saas-provisioning/upgrade` looks like:
  ```json
  {
    "ID": "<jobID>",
    "createdAt": "2022-12-12T13:07:15.817Z",
    "op": "upgrade",
    "tenants": {
        "t1": {
            "ID": "<taskID>"
        }
    }
  }
  ```

## Version 1.3.3 - 2022-12-01

### Changed

- The built-in Service Manager client now supports pagination tokens. This allows for more than 1250 tenants.

### Added

- The built-in Service Manager client now supports X.509 (mTLS) certificates in addition to the client-credentials authentication flow.
- `cds-mtx` commands now exit the process correctly on SAP HANA when there's an error in the command.
- SAP HANA encryption parameters are now correctly forwarded to the service-manager on subscription

### Fixed

- Improved error handling for the built-in Service Manager client.
- Tenant metadata can now be retrieved programmatically for all tenants via
    ```js
    const sps = await cds.connect.to('cds.xt.SaasProvisioningService')
    const tenants = await sps.get('/tenant')
    ```
- `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `upgrade` APIs of `cds.xt.SaasProvisioningService` can now also be called programmatically.

## Version 1.3.2 - 2022-11-17

### Fixed

- `cds-mtx` commands now exit the process correctly.

### Added

- `cds.requires['cds.xt.SaasProvisioningService'].jobs.clusterPoolSize` allows you to specify the number of concurrent HANA Cloud cluster tenant upgrades.
- `cds.requires['cds.xt.DeploymentService'].hdi.create.binding_parameters` now also works with the built-in Service Manager client.

### Changed

- Error handling for the built-in Service Manager client is improved.

## Version 1.3.1 - 2022-11-04

### Changed

- `cds.requires.multitenancy.for` settings have been moved to `cds.requires['cds.xt.DeploymentService'].for`.

## Version 1.3.0 - 2022-10-28

### Added

- `cds.requires['cds.xt.DeploymentService'].for` lets you define tenant-specific creation and deployment configuration.
  + For example: parameters for `t0` onboarding can be specified via `cds.requires['cds.xt.DeploymentService'].for.t0`. Analogous to the configuration in `cds.xt.DeploymentService` you can specify options for `create` and `deploy`.
- `cds.xt.DeploymentService`: The `t0` tenant is now onboarded on startup.
- `POST /-/cds/deployment/subscribe` saves onboarding metadata in `t0`.
- `POST /-/cds/deployment/unsubscribe` removes onboarding metadata for `t0`.
- [BETA] Command line tool `cds-mtx` now also allows to run `upgrade` in an application environment, e. g. `npx cds-mtx upgrade tenant1` or `cds-mtx upgrade tenant1` if you have installed `@sap/cds-mtxs` globally. This redeploys the current application model. Potential service handlers can be registered in `cli.js` (`server.js` is not loaded)

### Changed

- `@sap/instance-manager` has been replaced by a custom Service Manager client, which is now the default. You can switch back to the `@sap/instance-manager`-based client by setting `cds.requires['cds.xt.DeploymentService']['old-instance-manager']` to `true`.

### Fixed

- `/-/cds/saas-provisioning/upgrade` now also runs with DwC

## Version 1.2.0 - 2022-10-06

### Added

- `cds.xt.DeploymentService`: Additional parameters for HDI deployment (`@sap/hdi-deploy`) can now be added via the subscription request or the `cds` environment.

Via additional parameter in the subscription payload:

```
{
  "tenant": "tenant",
  "_": {
    "hdi": {
      "deploy": {
        "auto_undeploy": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Via `cds` environment:
```
...
"cds": {
  "requires": {
    "cds.xt.DeploymentService": {
      "hdi": {
        "deploy": {
          "auto_undeploy": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- `PUT /-/cds/saas-provisioning/tenant/<tenantId>` saves subscription metadata.
- `GET /-/cds/saas-provisioning/tenant/<tenantId>` returns the saved tenant metadata for `<tenantId>`.
- `GET /-/cds/saas-provisioning/tenant` returns the saved tenant metadata for all tenants.
- `GET /-/cds/deployment/getTables(tenant='<tenantId>)` returns all deployed tables for a tenant.
- [BETA] Command line tool `cds-mtx` allows to run `subscribe and unsubscribe` in an application environment, e. g. `npx cds-mtx subscribe tenant1` or `cds-mtx subscribe tenant1` if you have installed `@sap/cds-mtxs` globally.

### Changed

- `@sap/cds-mtxs@1.2.0` requires `@sap/cds@6.2`
- `POST /-/cds/saas-provisioning/upgrade` accepts a list of tenants like `upgrade(['t1', 't2'])`.
  + `upgrade(['*'])` upgrades all tenants.
- `POST /-/cds/saas-provisioning/upgrade` gets its tenants from the `t0` cache instead of the `saas-registry` service.
- `POST /-/cds/saas-provisioning/upgradeAll` has been deprecated and will be removed.
- `POST /-/cds/deployment/unsubscribe` is now idempotent for HANA as well.
- Polling interval to service-manager in `@sap/instance-manager` options has been increased to reduce rate-limiting problems.

## Version 1.1.2 - 2022-08-25

### Added

- `cds.xt.DeploymentService` now lets you register a `deploy` handler, invoked right before the HDI deployment is triggered.

## Version 1.1.1 - 2022-08-10

### Fixed

- `cds.xt.DeploymentService` can now also be called by users with role `cds.Subscriber`.

### Changed

- Log and debug output is improved.

## Version 1.1.0 - 2022-08-09

### Added

- `cds.xt.DeploymentService` can now be added via the subscription request or `cds` environment (e. g. HANA via service-manager).

  Via an additional parameter in the subscription payload:
  ```json
  {
    "subscribedTenantId": "tenant",
    "eventType": "CREATE",
    "_": {
      "hdi": {
        "create": {
          "provisioning_parameters": { "database_id" : "DB_ID" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Via the `cds` environment:
  ```json
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
    "cds.xt.DeploymentService": {
      "hdi": {
        "create": {
          "provisioning_parameters": { "database_id" : "DB_ID" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
